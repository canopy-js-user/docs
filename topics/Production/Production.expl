- If I make a provisional subcategory I can add a note to the parent reminding that it exists and should receive a forereference at some point â€“ ie AT: how do I get visibility into nearby categories that need to be subsumed?

- Maybe when all the children of a point cohere into 4 subcategories I descend.

- Most disambiguation is probably all global references, and maybe even new categories at every level.

I didn't see subcategories could proceed
