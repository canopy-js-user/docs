How Canopy works: Canopy takes [[explanation files]] and [[uses them to produce build data]], which [[the front-end client uses to build a web interface]] and [[the user interacts with it]].

Uses them to produce build data: The build process produces JSON files that tell the front-end client how to render the paragraphs of the project.

The front-end client uses to build a web interface: The web interface requests the default topic, and uses it to render the initial page.

The user interacts with it: When the user select a new link, the Canopy web interface rerenders the page.
