Project Path Prefix: A project path prefix is a string that comes after the domain name of your hosting provider. For example, if you will be hosting your project on `www.example.com/myProject/Topic_1`, then the project path prefix is "myProject". If you are hosting your project on `www.example.com/A/B/Topic_1`, then your project path prefix is `A/B`. Canopy needs to know about this string in order to determine what portion of the URL is the current [[page path string]]. The project path prefix is specified via the [[project path prefix parameter]] to the [[Canopy CLI build command]].
