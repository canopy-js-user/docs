The way that you sometimes zoom in and sometimes zoom out to analyze a thing

A course is like a diagraph in that everything you mention has to be connected to some previous thing, subsuming even the whole discipline.

We can add invariants like "how do you know" to every point.

Maybe there is a habit of only referencing entities even in prose if they have been imported via link in that paragraph or a direct ancestor.

Overlapping entities like a perek with sugya subtopics and the sugyas as topics, and the differences in how the same information is covered in those two contexts.
