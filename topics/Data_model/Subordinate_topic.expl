Subordinate topic: A subordinate topic is a topic that is usually only accessed via a global reference from a more frequently seen topic. Subordinate topics are contrasted with [[subtopic|subtopics]] as a way of expressing an idea that is subordinate to another. In general, subtopics should be used for ideas that cannot be explained without first having explained another, whereas subordinate topics can be used for ideas that can be explained independently, even if they require the context of a prior idea to be fully understood.
