Subtopic: Subtopics are a major type of entity in the Canopy data model. Subtopics belong to a [[topic]]. A subtopic models an entity or idea that requires additional context before it can be explained, as opposed to a [[topic]]. Because a subtopic requires context, it is displayed at a [[subtopic path]]. Sometimes information modeled using a subtopic should instead be modeled with a [[subordinate topic]]. It is important to know [[when to use topics versus subtopics]].
