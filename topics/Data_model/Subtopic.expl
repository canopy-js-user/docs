Subtopic: Subtopics are a major type of entity in the Canopy data model. Subtopics belong to a [[topic]], and exist in the [[topic tree|topic's tree]] and a particular [[subtopic path]]. Subtopics are for modeling entities or ideas that requires additional context before they can be explained, as opposed to a [[topic]]. Sometimes information modeled using a subtopic should instead be modeled with a [[subordinate topic]]. It is a best practice to know [[when to use topics versus subtopics]].
