Import reference: An import reference is a link to a [[subtopic]] of a different [[topic]]. Import references must be near a [[global reference]] to the topic of the target subtopic, and selecting the import reference displays the path from that topic to the subtopic in question. An import reference can sometimes be converted into a [[global reference]] by converting a subtopic to a [[subordinate topic]].
