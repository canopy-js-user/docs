Topic: Topics are the fundamental organizing units of information in a Canopy project. A Canopy topic is an explanation of some idea or entity. A topic is an entity that can be explained without prior context, as opposed to a [[subtopic]]. A topic in Canopy has a [[topic name]], and a [[topic paragraph]], whose [[subtopic|subtopics]] form a [[topic tree]]. The data of a topic is stored in a [[topic file]]. Every project must have a [[default topic]]. It is important to know [[when to use topics versus subtopics]].
