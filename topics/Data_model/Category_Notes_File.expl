Category Notes File: A category notes file is a file inside a [[category directory]] whose name follows the category name. A category notes file is for notes related to the category that do not yet have a permanent topic. Even if a category notes file has a valid topic key, unless that key matches the filename, the build process will ignore the file. This is to prevent false-positives where category notes begin with a question that is mistakenly interpreted as a topic key.
