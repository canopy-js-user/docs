Category: A category is an entity in the [[Canopy data model]] that helps organize [[topic|topics]]. Categories can contain other categories, and can contain topics. A top-level category is a category that is not inside any other category. Categories are [[merely an organizational tool]]. A category is represented on disk by a [[category directory]], and the category directory may contain a [[category notes file]].

Merely an organizational tool: Categories exist to help the author organize their [[topic|topics]], and categories do not affect the front-end behavior in any way. A user navigates to a topic directly, and then follows links to other topics, regardless of what categories those topics happen to be in. The URL path eg `A/B/C` does not represent a category hierarchy, but rather the chronology of the user's path through the various topics they've interacted with.
