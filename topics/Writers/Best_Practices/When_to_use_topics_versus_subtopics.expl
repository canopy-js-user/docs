When to use topics versus subtopics: It is often ambiguous whether to represent a tangential idea as a [[subtopic]] or a [[subordinate topic]]. In general, if something could be explained in its own right without first explaining the original idea, even if no reader will end up doing so, it makes sense to model it as a subordinate topic. If something cannot be explained without first mentioning another idea, it should be a subtopic. Another rule of thumb is that names that contain other names should be subtopics, eg "the North entrance to Newark airport."
