When to repeat versus reference content: Not every idea that is mentioned in multiple places should be referenced by link, because sometimes the author is trying to define an idea for a local purpose, and not send the reader meandering to a new topic and all its relations. In such a case, the author might repeat information that can be found elsewhere as subtopics of a given topic, so that the reader only sees that which is necessary for the current point being made, (and if the reader chooses to read more, a hyperlink to the topic proper can be included in parentheses, indicating optionality)
