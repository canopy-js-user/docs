Creating hyperlinks that follow sentence syntax: It is common to find [[hyperlinks that do not match sentence syntax]], but it is recommended to instead [[create intermediary syntactic subtopics]].

Hyperlinks that do not match sentence syntax: If I have the sentence "Bob lives on 4th Street", and I make the word "street" into a hyperlink to the topic of "streets" generally, then this is a hyperlink that does not match sentence syntax, because in our sentence, "4th Street" is one unit, and it is a name, and so the word "street" is not actually being used as the generic term, (like in the sentence: "I prefer streets to alleyways,") and so if one hyperlinks "4th `street`" to the generic topic "street", then there is a mismatch between how the term is being used syntactically and what the hyperlink is pointing to, which can be confusing to the reader.

Create intermediary syntactic subtopics: If I have the sentence "Bob lives on 4th Street," and I am worried that someone will not know what a "street" is, and I want to link them to that concept, then rather than linkifying the word "street", I can create a subtopic called "4th Street", and make "Bob lives on `4th Street`" a local reference to that subtopic, and in the [[subtopic paragraph]] I can say "4th Street is a `street`", and put the hyperlink in the subtopic, and thus, I am able to offer the reader a definition of the word "street", without creating any hyperlinks that are mismatched to sentence syntax.
