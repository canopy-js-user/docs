Education: Canopy can [[help organize pedagogic content knowledge]], [[offer more clarificatory information]], and [[make accessing prerequisites easier]].

Help organize pedagogic content knowledge: Sometimes there are specific examples or analogies that help strengthen students' intuitions for why a given point is true, but not every teacher might know of every such example, so Canopy can help produce amalgam works that have room to collect all such examples.

Offer more clarificatory information: It isn't always clear to everyone what the author means by a certain statement, but it might be clear to most students, so Canopy allows the author to include as much clarification as they want, allowing a student who is confused to get more explanation without forcing students who understand to wade through it.

Make accessing prerequisites easier: Every point assumes some prior knowledge, but a textbook can't explain every such point, yet some students will be lacking prior knowledge on a given point and will be prevented from understanding, so Canopy lets the author explain required background information only for those students who need it, and not for those students who don't.

Some aspects of teaching are universal, but sometimes a certain topic has specific pedagogic information that is helpful for students, like analogies or examples that provide intuitive reasons why a certain fact is true, yet sometimes it is hard for students to find this type of information, and space limits on linear works make it hard to include everything, but because Canopy enables explanations of larger [[scale]] and the expression of [[explanatory invariants]], those interested can produce pedagogic works that attempt to cumulatively assemble all such knowledge for a discipline.
