Mouse interactions: To navigate by mouse, you can [[click local references]] and you can [[click global references]].

Click Local References: If you click a [[local reference]], the target paragraph will be inlined below the current paragraph.

Click Global References: If you click a [[global reference]], if alt/option is not pressed, the target paragraph will be inlined below the current paragraph, and if alt/option _is_ pressed, then the page will redirect to the target paragraph as the new page root.
