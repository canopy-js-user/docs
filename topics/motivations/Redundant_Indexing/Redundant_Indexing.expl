Redundant Indexing: Redundant indexing is the idea that [[the different entities of a subject area can be organized in different ways]], and [[Canopy lets you explore the data of a project in these different organizations]].

The different entities of a subject area can be organized in different ways: You could have the battles of a given war organized chronologically, or you could also have them organized by size or length, so we want the same entities with all their details to be available via different organizational schemes.

Canopy lets you explore the data of a project in these different organizations: Canopy lets you define a set of topics with all their details and subcomponents, but also to define arbitrarily many indexes of these topics, listing different groups of topics in different ways, and no matter what manner you arrive at a given topic, you can still burrow into the details and remind yourself of the specifics of the topic before trying to redundantly index it via multiple organizational schemes.
