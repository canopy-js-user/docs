Non-rival media: In books, including one point comes at the expense of space for another point, whereas in non-linear media which can grow happily to any size, including one point doesn't crowd out other point for space, although [[even in non-linear media points crowd out others for attention]].

Even in non-linear media points crowd out others for attention: Because Canopy has hierarchy, the size of each paragraph is small, and so even if there is unlimited space for points in general, there is limited space for a point to get referenced at "top billing" in the paragraph for a given idea.
