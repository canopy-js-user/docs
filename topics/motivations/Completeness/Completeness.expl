Completeness: Completeness is the idea that once an author is able to [[scale|produce works at any scale]], it will be possible to achieve completeness of analysis, such as [[recursive consideration of arguments]], and [[non-inclusion will be clearly intentional]].

Recursive consideration of arguments: Sometimes an author will give an argument for a view, and maybe also show a problem with the argument, but in theory, the tree of arguments and problems with the arguments, and problems with the problems, etc, can become very large, and it is difficult to achieve such coverage of even a small subject area.

Non-inclusion will be clearly intentional: At present, if an author doesn't include a given point or argument, they can claim it is because there isn't space to consider every view. With [[non-rival media]] however, when the author doesn't include a point, it will be more clearly a choice, which might motivate authors to present wider coverage.

Non-rival media: In books, including one point comes at the expense of space for another point, whereas in non-linear media which can grow happily to any size, including one point doesn't crowd out other point for space, although [[even in non-linear media points crowd out others for attention]].

Even in non-linear media points crowd out others for attention: Because Canopy has [[hierarchy]], the size of each paragraph is small, and so even if there is unlimited space for points in general, there is limited space for a point to get referenced at "top billing" in the paragraph for a given idea.
