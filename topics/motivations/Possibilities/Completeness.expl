Completeness: Completeness is the idea that once an author is able to produce works of larger [[scale]], it will be possible to achieve completeness of analysis, such as [[recursive consideration of arguments]], so [[non-inclusion will be clearly intentional]] and [[the costs of including objectionable content will be lower]].

Recursive consideration of arguments: Sometimes an author will give an argument for a view, and maybe also show a problem with the argument, but in theory, the tree of arguments and problems with the arguments, and problems with the problems, etc, can become very large, and it is difficult to achieve such coverage of even a small subject area.

Non-inclusion will be clearly intentional: At present, if an author doesn't include a given point or argument, they can claim it is because there isn't space to consider every view. With [[non-rival media]] however, when the author doesn't include a point, it will be more clearly a choice, which might motivate authors to present wider coverage.

The costs of including objectionable content will be lower: Many are skeptical of including coverage of arguments they disagree with for fear a reader will see the argument and not the rebuttal, and walk away with an incorrect view, but in Canopy (which has [[informed abridgement]]), the same paragraph that mentions a view will include mention of its rebuttal, and so the reader can only come away with an incomplete view if they themselves choose to, making it less risky for authors to include discussion of objectionable views.
