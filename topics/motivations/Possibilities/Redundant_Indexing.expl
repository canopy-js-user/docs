Redundant Indexing: Redundant indexing is the idea that [[the different entities of a subject area can be organized in different ways]], and [[Canopy lets you explore the data of a project in these different organizations]].

The different entities of a subject area can be organized in different ways: You might want to access a list of diseases by the part of the body they affect, but you might also want to practice recalling them based on symptoms, so we want to access the same entities with all their optional detail, but via different organizational schemes.

Canopy lets you explore the data of a project in these different organizations: Canopy lets you define a set of topics with all their details and subcomponents, but also to define arbitrarily many indexes of these topics, listing different groups of topics in different ways, and no matter what manner you arrive at a given topic, you can still burrow into the details and remind yourself of the specifics of the topic before trying to redundantly index it via multiple organizational schemes.
