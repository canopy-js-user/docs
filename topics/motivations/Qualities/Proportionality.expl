Proportionality: Proportionality is the idea that because [[Canopy organizes information hierarchically]], if [[one reads top to bottom]], [[one will end up with a proportional understanding]], [[unlike reading a book or article]].

Canopy organizes information hierarchically: Canopy takes a domain and lists the important topics in it, and for each topic it lists the major ideas, and for the major ideas it lists the details, etc.

One reads top to bottom: If one reads about all the big ideas before burrowing into details.

One will end up with a proportional understanding: Whether a person has one hour to read about a subject or one year, if they read the hierarchy top-down, then they will end up with the most accurate picture of the subject matter possible given that time constraint, because they are always reading about the big ideas before going into any details.

Unlike reading a book or article: When reading a book or article, if one only has time for a small portion of it, it is very hard to allocate that time effectively to find the subset of the work that paints the most accurate picture given the time constraint. One is likely to end up with certain concepts in great detail, while not knowing anything about certain other ones.
