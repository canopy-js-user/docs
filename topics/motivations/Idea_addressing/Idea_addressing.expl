Idea addressing: Idea addressing is that rather than having [[the unit of information]] be [[the category]] or [[the work]], [[we can address individual ideas]].

The unit of information: An information system is broken up into units that can be spoken about and recommended to other people individually. I can recommend a book or a chapter of a book, but it is hard to recommend a specific paragraph because it has no "name" in the system.

The category: In a traditional library, one unit of information is the category, ie the collection of works on a certain topic. The category has a name, so that people can communicate about it effectively.

The work: In a traditional library, one unit of information is the work, like a book or periodical. The work has a name so that people can communicate about it effectively.

We can address individual ideas: In Canopy, every idea gets a paragraph, and every idea gets a name, and from that name the idea gets a URL, and so we can speak about ideas and recommend explanations on a much finer-grain basis.
